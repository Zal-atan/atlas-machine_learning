    Performs the expectation maximization for a GMM

    Inputs:
    X - numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) containing the data set
    k - positive integer containing the number of clusters
    iterations - positive integer containing the maximum number of iterations
    for the algorithm
    tol - non-negative float containing tolerance of the log likelihood, used
    to determine early stopping i.e. if the difference is less than or equal
    to tol you should stop the algorithm
    verbose - boolean that determines if you should print information about
    the algorithm

    Returns: pi, m, S, g, l, or None, None, None, None, None on failure
    pi - numpy.ndarray of shape (k,) containing the updated priors
    for each cluster
    m - numpy.ndarray of shape (k, d) containing the updated centroid means
    for each cluster
    S - numpy.ndarray of shape (k, d, d) containing the updated covariance
    matrices for each cluster
    g - numpy.ndarray of shape (k, n) containing the probabilities for each
    data point in each cluster
    l - log likelihood of the model
